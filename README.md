# Scala Git

This code project is to serve as a way for me to understand the Git repository 
format intimately and also allow me to learn Scala core libraries better.

I will not be binding all Git commands to Scala through JNI (or any derivative
the purpose is to write and parse/read Git repository objects to do common Git
tasks. It will not provide an exhaustive coverage of Git commands though.

## Usage

Coming soon. Need to write some code first.
